>Different taxes and duties are involved when it comes to importation of motor vehicles in any country. The mathematics and calculations involved can be fairly to get right especially for people who daily activities doent revolve around accounts and finance.

>Even to guys working in accounts and finance departments, it would be hectic to compute for the taxes and levies using a pen, book and calculator as it also increases the margin of error significantly moreso when a large number of cars is involved.
